# Reflection for Week Five

This week I got to use my skills as a bachelor of journalism and apply them to the digital history relam. This week was all about different way to tell stories and telling stories is what I do best. 

I tried a wide array of the activities this week, the only one I didn't get to was the static websites. I will go through the other three each in turn below.

## Posters

I will be honest in saying that when I saw we were going to learn how to make academic posters I was a bit put off. I figured I've been making posters since the second grade so what's the big deal? But when I started using inkscape I really enjoyed it. With the tutorial graph I spent a lot of time with colours and analyzing how to use colour to show trend. I found this very interesting.

I then went to make my own academic poster. I made this poster on a term paper that I wrote last year for a course called Social and Cultural History of Canada (HIST 2304). I broke my paper down into sections and gave important details in each section. I also added graphics; some were made by me on inkscape and some were clipart. In a critical evaluation of my own poster I think I should have made reference to the actual column of articles in greater detail. For this reason, I am going to try to create a corpus of this newspaper column. I would like to use this as part of my final assignment for this course next week. I will pull all the articles together and do ome work with text analysis, REGEX, Topic Modelling, etc. I would like to try to turn the work I did last year into a digital history project.

I showed the poster to my mum. She had previously read the paper but she helped me to evaulate whether the stuff I was puttning in the poster was of greatest importance. I also sent the poster to my boyfriend. He had no prior knowledge of my paper. He said he thought the graphics were good and that the colour scheme of the poster made sense. One suggestion he had was to add arrows for the flow of information. He also said that it was gripping enough that he would enjoy a link to read more!
