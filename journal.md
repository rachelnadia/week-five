# Reflection for Week Five

This week I got to use my skills as a bachelor of journalism and apply them to the digital history relam. This week was all about different way to tell stories and telling stories is what I do best. 

I tried a wide array of the activities this week, the only one I didn't get to was the static websites. I will go through the other three each in turn below.

## Posters

I will be honest in saying that when I saw we were going to learn how to make academic posters I was a bit put off. I figured I've been making posters since the second grade so what's the big deal? But when I started using inkscape I really enjoyed it. With the tutorial graph I spent a lot of time with colours and analyzing how to use colour to show trend. I found this very interesting.

I then went to make my own academic poster. I made this poster on a term paper that I wrote last year for a course called Social and Cultural History of Canada (HIST 2304). I broke my paper down into sections and gave important details in each section. I also added graphics; some were made by me on inkscape and some were clipart. In a critical evaluation of my own poster I think I should have made reference to the actual column of articles in greater detail. For this reason, I am going to try to create a corpus of this newspaper column. I would like to use this as part of my final assignment for this course next week. I will pull all the articles together and do ome work with text analysis, REGEX, Topic Modelling, etc. I would like to try to turn the work I did last year into a digital history project.

I showed the poster to my mum. She had previously read the paper but she helped me to evaulate whether the stuff I was puttning in the poster was of greatest importance. I also sent the poster to my boyfriend. He had no prior knowledge of my paper. He said he thought the graphics were good and that the colour scheme of the poster made sense. One suggestion he had was to add arrows for the flow of information. He also said that it was gripping enough that he would enjoy a link to read more!

## Mapping

I used StoryMap to make a quick trial map of my family ethnicity. I think the userface of the platform is very easy to use however, I think every map made with StoryMap is bound to be pretty similar. I like the idea of Leaflet but I didn't have time to get through the whole tutorial. I think that Leaflet would be an excellent way to make a creative, innovative, and useful map. 

## Sound

For sound I tried both sonification and a podcast. For the sonification I used Ontario COVID-19 data. I overlayed new daily cases, daily deaths, and total cases. The total cases served as my background beat and while I made the volume quiet, the upward trend of the cases was easily identifiable. For the new daily cases and daily deaths it was interesting to compare the relationship between the two and to see that deaths follow a trend that is about 10 days behind new daily cases. I also made it so that when deaths were higher the voume of that layer increased. This added an interesting element to the sound. I sent this piece to my mum without context, I only told her is was COVID-19 data and the first thing she picked up was the overall increasing trend. 

I was very excited to make a podcast. In my audio journalism course we learned a lot about the methods of podcasting but I never got to complete the final assignment for it because of COVID-19. I used Adobe Audition for mine instead of Audacity. While Audacity is nice becasue it is free, I ahve used both in audio settings before and Adobe Audition is much more friendly. I overlayed some sound efects and background music using a multitrack session (I felt like I was in my audio journalism class again). When I sent this to my boyfriend he said it sounded like I was on an episode of Serial.

Overall, I had a lot of fun this week tying everything together and bringing my storyteller skills from journalism to the forefront.
