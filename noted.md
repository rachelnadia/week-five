# Notes for Week Five

## Posters
- I was not looking forward to this part
- thought it would be the same as making posters in highschool
- I was wrong this was way more in depth
- I spent 3+ hours on my poster that I made for a previous paper I've written
- The paper was based on a newspaper column
- I want to try and create a corpus of this column to use in my final assignment

## Mapping
- I've used StoryMap before and while it looks decent it's a little boring
- I started the mapping with Leaflet which was a lot more in-depth but I didn't get it finished

## Sound
- I was so excited to create a podcast
- learned all the techniques of doing so in my audio journalism class but didn't get to do the final project because of COVID smh
- very fun to do
- I used Adobe audition instead of Audacity. I have used both audio tools before and while Audacity is more accessible becasue it is free, Audition is way more friendly
- My boyfriend said it sounded like I was about to record an episode of Serial

- the sonification was a new skill I learned
- I used ot be very into instrumental music so I liked listening to the patterns
- overlayed daily new cases, daily deaths, and total cases
- lowered the total cases in the background as a beat yet th increase is still very apparent
